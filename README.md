This sample project shows how to implement Expandable/Collapsable TableView as a sliding menu iOS. The sliding menu draws in and out on tap of menu button in Navigation bar. The TableView expands and collapses table on selecting a row. 
If there are any sub-items in a row, then the row expands to show the indented sub-items. Expanding and collapsing actions come naturally while using this.

Anyone intending to customise it can do so very easily by changing the color or accesories in the table view.
